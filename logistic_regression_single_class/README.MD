## This is a simple logistic regression with two classes (0's and 1's)
## OVR (one versus rest) - if there are three labels like 0,1,2 then it will be created 3 models
## Logistic regression by creating a inbalanced dataset

## Features
1. Create a dataset using make_classification
2. Train model using Logistic Regression
3. Predict the data point 
4. Use metric accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
5. Hyperparameter turning using StratifiedKFold
6. Use cross validation like GridsearchCV and RandomisedCV


## Metrics
1. accuracy_score
2. classification_report
3. confusion_matrix
